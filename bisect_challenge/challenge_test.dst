It is appropriate to authorize Member States to temporarily maintain their national provisions for raw materials contaminated by aflatoxin other than those listed in Part A of Annex II or for undesirable substances or products other than aflatoxin which adversely affect the quality of the raw materials . <SEP> A Community decision must be adopted before 3 December 1990 so that uniform Community rules on the presence of undesirable substances and products in the raw materials used in the manufacture of animal feed apply at that time .
In the case of a regulation on an exclusively voluntary basis , only some devices would be provided with uniform labels or product information; this could lead to confusion for the consumer . <SEP> The present regulation is therefore intended to ensure that the energy consumption of all devices in question is indicated by means of uniform labels and product information .
Every Member State must be able to ban imports from a third country immediately if they could pose a threat to animal health . <SEP> In this case , without prejudice to any changes in the list of countries authorized to export to the Community , the position of all the Member States towards the third country concerned must be coordinated immediately .

Since the introduction of the co-responsibility levy on 16 September 1977 , insurmountable administrative difficulties have arisen in levying the levy in areas of the Community where the average quantity of milk delivered to dairies per day and per producer is less than 10 kg . <SEP> Therefore , these milk quantities are to be excluded from the levy of the levy .
( 2 ) The aim of the treaty is to create an economic union with healthy competition and conditions similar to that of the internal market . <SEP> In the tobacco sector , this presupposes that the excise duties levied in the Member States on products in this sector do not distort the conditions of competition and do not hinder the free movement of these products in the common market .
( 3 ) In order to ensure a high recognition value , the labeling should be as informative as possible and contain standardized information that is as brief as possible . <SEP> The emblem should therefore only be used in accordance with the technical specifications of the graphic manual .
Directive 64/433 / EEC only applies to fresh meat for intra-Community trade . <SEP> However , the authorities of the Member States have introduced national rules for the control of fresh meat intended exclusively for the domestic market .
Even if lighters were made in Taiwan , there is no indication of what proportion of exports this production accounted for . <SEP> Furthermore , in the absence of any cooperation from Taiwanese producers , it is considered that an investigation under Article 13 ( 2 ) of the basic Regulation would reveal that any production in Taiwan would constitute a circumvention of the existing measures .
Since the implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture , the Commission has been able to follow the evolution of the quantities for which special refunds are granted on the basis of export licenses . <SEP> Therefore , the notifications from the Member States referred to in Article 9 are not required .

The quantities covered by the inward processing regime can only be determined if the imports were made under this regime . <SEP> The coefficient cannot be determined before August 1st each year in cases where the inward processing regime applies during the marketing year in which the coefficient applies .
Since an assessment of the undeveloped land was not available , the commission made an estimate by deducting the development costs from the value of the developed property . <SEP> In doing so , it has taken into account the anticipated delay from the sale of the land in plots , the financial cost of the project and the fact that land would be required for infrastructure .
Fees should only be charged for examining dossiers on certain additives . <SEP> The appropriate groups of additives should be included in a list .

The complete abolition of controls and formalities at intra-Community borders presupposes that certain basic conditions are met . <SEP> In its White Paper on "Completing the Internal Market" , the Commission stated that the abolition of checks on persons and security checks on goods carried would require , among other things , an approximation of the law on weapons .
Montelukast is metabolized by CYP 3A4 . <SEP> Therefore , caution is required , especially in children , when co-administering montelukast with CYP 3A4 inducing drugs such as phenytoin , phenobarbital and rifampin .
In terms of financing and technical equipment , the commitments include: a reduction in the duration of the agreement; customers are given the option of reimbursement and termination of the contract without compensation; and part of the cooling space is cleared . <SEP> This addresses concerns that pre-existing arrangements would unlawfully bind customers and lead to the exclusivity of the outlets .
There is a need to significantly strengthen the transparency and non-discrimination guarantees . <SEP> In order to have a noticeable effect , there must be opportunities for effective and rapid review .
In order to carry out the verification of the frequency of checks provided for in Article 3 ( 3 ) , Member States need to gain more experience . <SEP> The date of application of the frequency of checks should therefore be set at 1 January 1997 .

In view of the relative importance of non-scheduled air traffic in some Member States , measures need to be taken to mitigate its impact on the competitive opportunities of airlines in the Member States to which this traffic is directed . <SEP> However , the measures to be taken should not aim to limit or regulate the demand for air travel .
Regulation ( EC ) No . 1439/95 also lists the authorities that are authorized in the exporting third countries to issue certificates of origin . <SEP> Since a different authority is responsible for this in Poland from November 15 , 1995 , Annex I of that regulation should be amended accordingly .
Some Member States need mixtures of forage seed of several genera and species for specific seed purposes . <SEP> In order to meet this need , Member States must be empowered to authorize such mixtures under certain conditions .

( 2 ) According to the Treaty , the ECB shall be consulted by national authorities on all draft legislation falling within its remit . <SEP> It is for the Council to determine the limits and modalities of this consultation .
Differences in the maximum levels of pesticide residues allowed in the individual Member States can create barriers to trade and thus hinder the free movement of goods within the Community . <SEP> It is therefore appropriate to set certain maximum levels that may be used in the Member States .
If a Member State where catches are landed fails to take effective action against irregularities , this means for the flag Member State that it can no longer fully guarantee compliance with the rules for the conservation and management of fishery resources . <SEP> Provision should therefore be made for illegal catches to be counted against the quota of the Member State of landing if it has not taken effective legal action .
If the payment is wrongly made due to an error by the competent authority , no interest will be charged . <SEP> At most , an amount to be determined by the Member State based on the wrongly obtained advantage will be charged .

Regulation ( EEC ) No . 2658/87 introduced a product nomenclature , the so-called "Combined Nomenclature" , which at the same time meets the requirements of the Common Customs Tariff and those of the Community's external trade statistics . <SEP> This nomenclature is based on the Convention on the Harmonized System for Describing and Coding Goods , which replaces the Convention of December 15 , 1950 .
The granting of an export refund for cereals imported from third countries in order to be re-exported to third countries does not seem justified . <SEP> Refunds are therefore only granted for Community products .

Given the slower development of the nuclear energy sector and the change in political attitudes towards nuclear energy in some Member States , this financing option for nuclear energy projects is unlikely to be used very intensively in the Community in the coming years .
So that the consumer is protected in his physical integrity and his property , the determination of the defectiveness of a product is not based on its inability to use , but on a lack of security , which the general public can justifiably expect . <SEP> In assessing this safety , any improper use of the product which must be considered unreasonable in the circumstances in question shall be avoided .
The above-mentioned tuna pieces have lost the character of a product under tariff number 03 . 01 as a result of the heat treatment; they are therefore to be assigned to tariff number 16 . 04 . <SEP> Within this tariff number , tariff position 16 . 04 E comes into consideration .

( 26 ) If agreements exempted by this Regulation nevertheless have effects which are incompatible with Article 85 ( 3 ) , the Commission may withdraw the legal advantage of the block exemption . <SEP> This is particularly useful if the licensed products are not exposed to effective competition in the licensed area ( Article 7 ) .
Persons and organizations who can assert a legitimate interest under the law of a Member State <SEP> To protect the consumer , proceedings must be instituted in the courts or administrative authorities responsible for deciding on lawsuits or complaints or the initiation of legal proceedings which deal with contractual terms with a view to general use in consumer contracts , in particular unfair terms can .

( 1 ) Council Directive 92/65 / EEC ( 3 ) lays down the main animal health conditions which Member States must comply with when importing dogs , cats and other rabies-endangered animals from third countries . <SEP> The veterinary certificates have not yet been standardized .
The eligible production quantities must be determined for each producer . <SEP> It is up to the Member States to distribute these quotas among the producers concerned within the guarantee thresholds set; Community legislation on this subject aims to ensure fair allocation on the basis of quantities supplied in the past , without , however , taking into account any abnormal production found .
The different provisions of Article 7 ( 1 ) are no longer applied by the Member States . <SEP> Therefore they should be deleted .

( 4 ) The control of residues as required by the relevant Community legislation will usually require the setting of maximum residue limits in the tissues , liver or kidneys to be examined . <SEP> However , liver and kidneys are often removed from carcases destined for international trade and therefore maximum residue limits in muscle or adipose tissue should always be set .
( 4 ) The functioning of the common market and the transition to the single currency require that citizens and businesses in all Member States have legal certainty with regard to certain provisions in connection with the introduction of the euro well before the start of the third stage consists . <SEP> This early legal certainty enables citizens and companies to be optimally prepared .

The health marking of poultrymeat by the official veterinarian is the best way to give the competent authorities of the place of destination an assurance that a consignment complies with the provisions of this Directive . <SEP> Nevertheless , the health certificate with regard to the control of the destination of poultry meat must also be retained if animal health aspects are concerned .
In order to guarantee the authenticity of the variety and the correct marketing of vegetable propagating material and vegetable planting material , Community rules must be laid down for the separation of the lots and for labeling . <SEP> The marking used must contain the information required for the official inspection and for informing the user .

Such standards can help improve the quality of poultry meat and thus promote the sale of this meat . <SEP> It is therefore in the interests of producers , traders and consumers that marketing standards be used for poultrymeat intended for human consumption .
There are differences within the community in the rules governing access to equestrian events . <SEP> These differences can hinder intra-Community trade .
The industrial fishery for herring in the Baltic Sea can generate significant by-catches of young cod . <SEP> This fishery should therefore not be allowed in areas where young cod is abundant .

Regulation ( EEC ) No . 2658/87 laid down general rules for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature . <SEP> These provisions also apply to the interpretation of any other nomenclature that the Combined Nomenclature - even only partially or with the addition of subdivisions - and which has been drawn up on the basis of special Community regulations in order to apply tariff or other measures in the context of the movement of goods .
( 4 ) Databases are protected by copyright in various forms in the Member States through legal or judicial law . <SEP> As long as the laws of the Member States continue to differ in the scope and conditions of protection , such non-harmonized intellectual property rights can impede the free movement of goods and services within the Community .
At the meeting of the European Council in Amsterdam on 16 and 17 June 1997 , the decision of the Intergovernmental Conference to incorporate the agreement on social policy into the EC Treaty was welcomed . <SEP> It was also pointed out that a way would have to be found to give legal effect to the willingness of the United Kingdom to agree to the directives already adopted under this agreement and to any directives that may be adopted before the entry into force of the new treaty .
The Commission ensures that the establishment of harmonized standards for all areas covered by the essential safety requirements in Annex II is completed in good time so that the Member States can adopt and publish the necessary provisions before 1 July 1989 . <SEP> The national legislation adopted on the basis of this directive should therefore take effect on 1 January 1990 .

Council Directive 92/121 / EEC of 21 December 1992 on the supervision and control of large exposures held by credit institutions ( 6 ) does not seek to establish common rules for the monitoring of large risks in transactions where market risks primarily exist . <SEP> This directive refers to another Community initiative which aims to provide the necessary coordination of procedures in this area .
Policyholders who , due to their characteristics , their importance or the type of risk to be covered , do not require any special protection in the country in which the risk is located must be given unlimited freedom to choose from the broadest possible insurance market . <SEP> On the other hand , the other policyholders must be guaranteed adequate protection .
( 2 ) Decision 93/383 / EEC does not provide for a procedure for the rapid amendment of its Annex . <SEP> It should therefore be stipulated that the Commission may amend this Annex following notification from a Member State .

In an effort to protect agricultural or food products which can be identified by their geographical origin , some Member States have introduced "controlled designations of origin" . <SEP> These have not only developed to the satisfaction of the producers , who earn a higher income in return for real quality efforts , but also of the consumers , who can thus fall back on specific products with guarantees for production method and origin .
The laundering of the proceeds of illegal activities has had an evident impact on the growth of organized crime in general and drug trafficking in particular . <SEP> The public is becoming increasingly aware that the fight against money laundering is one of the most effective means of combating this type of crime , which poses a particular threat to Member State societies .
