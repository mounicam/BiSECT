Whereas the Member States should be entitled , with the Commission's authorization , to grant certain vehicles exemptions from the provisions of the Regulation in exceptional circumstances; whereas , in urgent cases , it should be possible to grant these exemptions for a limited time without prior authorization from the Commission.
Whereas in certain very small regions of the Community where conditions are particularly unsuited to the production of bananas but better suited to alternative crops the definitive cessation of banana production should be encouraged through a premium for the cessation of banana production; whereas , in order to limit the cost of this operation , grubbing up should be carried out as soon as possible.
Whereas under Article 6 ( 3 ) of Directive 85/511/EEC the rules of Member States should be amended to ensure coordination in this field throughout the Community; whereas this coordination should lay down a minimum set of rules to be applied in all Member States.
The condition as set out in paragraph 1 ( b ) of the Annex provided for Bombardier to enter into a Joint Development Agreement with ETR for cooperation between these two companies until 2006 in relation to the tram "CityRunner Type Linz" , for which ETR supplies the electrical traction , thereby allowing ETR to continue to be active in the market for trams .
Whereas , to ensure a standardized system throughout the Community , a Community reference laboratory should be designated which will be responsible for coordinating the monitoring of marine biotoxins carried out by each national reference laboratory; whereas the tasks and operating conditions of the Community reference laboratory should be laid down.
Whereas trade in equidae intended for competitions and participation in such competitions may be jeopardized by disparities existing in the rules concerning the allocation of a percentage of the prize money or profits for the safeguard , development and improvement of breeding in the Member States; whereas introducing free access to the competitions presupposes harmonization of these rules.
Whereas , to minimize the disadvantages accruing from adjustments to the farm return , the new provisions should be applied in all Member States with effect from one and the same accounting year ; whereas it is nonetheless desirable , in view of the difficulties which certain Member States may encounter in making these adjustments within a single year , to make provision for those Member States to postpone the application of the new provisions for one accounting year.
Whereas Article 13 ( 2 ) of Regulation ( EEC ) No 1766/92 provides for the possibility of differentiating the refund according to destination; whereas , therefore , objective criteria should be provided for which would lead to the abolition of the refund for certain destinations.
Whereas procedures for informing and consulting employees as embodied in legislation or practice in the Member States are often not geared to the transnational structure of the entity which takes the decisions affecting those employees; whereas this may lead to the unequal treatment of employees affected by decisions within one and the same undertaking or group of undertakings.
Whereas , since the abovementioned aid will be restricted to the quantities sold on the Community market , provision must be made for granting production aid at a fixed rate to compensate for restricting consumption aid to the said quantities ; whereas , to avoid structural surpluses , this production aid should be granted only in respect of areas planted with olive trees on the date on which the new system enters into force.
Whereas no distinction between the consequences of failure to meet an obligation should be made based on whether or not an advance payment has been received; whereas , accordingly , secufrities given against advances are covered by separate rules.
Whereas for the purposes of this Directive financial services do not include the instruments of monetary , exchange rate , public debt , reserve management , and other policies involving transactions in securities and other financial instruments; whereas , therefore , contracts in connection with the issue , sale , purchase or transfer of securities and other financial instruments are not covered by this Directive; whereas central bank services are also excluded.
The first injection of FRF 500 million having proved insufficient , the State decided to grant France 2 two more capital injections in 1993 and 1994 , the latter being implemented following a fresh audit by Coopers & Lybrand and at the same time as a further cost cutting plan .
( 2 ) Whereas , following a restructuring of the Australian administration , the competent authority for health certificates for fishery products ( AQIS ) has changed from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to the Department of Agriculture , Fisheries and Forestry and this new authority is capable of effectively verifying the application of the laws in force; whereas it is , therefore , necessary to modify the nomination of the competent authority named by Decision 97/427/EC.

Whereas , when a company belongs to a group , it is desirable that group accounts giving a true and fair view of the activities of the group as a whole be published ; whereas , however , pending the entry into force of a Council Directive on consolidated accounts , derogations from certain provisions of this Directive are necessary.
Whereas every Member State must have the right to place an immediate prohibition on imports from a third country when such imports may be dangerous for human and animal health; whereas , in such a case , coordination of the attitudes of the Member States with regard to that third country must be ensured without delay , without prejudice to possible amendments to the list of countries authorized to export to the Community.
Whereas the effectiveness of efforts to eliminate money laundering is particularly dependent on the close coordination and harmonization of national implementing measures; whereas such coordination and harmonization which is being carried out in various international bodies requires , in the Community context , cooperation between Member States and the Commission in the framework of a contact committee.
In the IP , despite an increase in the prices , costs increased above prices , mostly due to an increase in the prices of CPT , the main input in the production of CTVs , and to the pressure exerted on prices by imports , thus preventing the profitability of the Community industry from improving to the levels in 1997 and 1998 .
Where the particulars provided by the applicant are incomplete , the competent authorities set a time limit for completion of the application , in which case the rejection may not precede the expiry of the time limit .
The Community Industry raised certain concerns that a possible "spill-over" of Ukrainian silicon carbide into the EU-15 had occurred , however , during a verification visit by the Commission , it was established that the silicon carbide in question was not of Ukrainian origin .
Whereas the two procedures provided for in Article 13 ( 3 ) are described in detail in Annex III to Directive 89/106/EEC; whereas it is necessary therefore to specify clearly the methods by which the two procedures must be implemented , by reference to Annex III , for each product or family of products , since Annex III gives preference to certain systems.
Whereas , in the case of applications concerning quantities equal to or less than 25 tonnes , the export licence should be issued immediately if the trader requests it; whereas these licences , however , should benefit from refunds only in accordance with the measures which the Commission might possibly have taken for the period in question.
Whereas , in order better to estimate dietary intake of pesticide residues , it is prudent to establish simultaneously , where possible , maximum residue levels for individual pesticides in all major components of the diet; whereas these levels represent the use of minimum quantities of pesticide to achieve adequate control , applied in such a manner that the amount of residue is the smallest practicable and is toxicologically acceptable.
Whereas the provisions on transit and proof of the Community status of goods carried by sea are inadequate because of the particular features of sea transport which have no counterpart in other types of transport; whereas it is consequently impossible under the current provisions to guarantee collection of customs debt and other charges on goods.
Whereas , likewise , in order to avoid situations in which large numbers of undersized individuals are caught , it is necessary to protect certain zones where juveniles congregate , taking account of the local biological conditions in these various zones; whereas it is furthermore appropriate that , when regulating fisheries in the Mediterranean , both Community and national legislation should take into account the special needs of particular species and environments recognized to be fragile or endangered.
Without prejudice to Article 18 ( 1 ) of Decision 2000/596/EC , the guidelines shall cover the organisation of the management and control systems necessary to ensure the accuracy , regularity and eligibility of requests for Community funding and shall refer to the generally recognised standards of good administrative practice set out in Annex I .

Whereas Council Directive 84/360/EEC of 28 June 1984 on the combating of air pollution from industrial plants ( 10 ) provides that prior authorization shall be required to operate new industrial installations and in particular waste incineration plants; whereas this authorization may be issued only when all appropriate preventive measures against air pollution have been taken , including the application of the best available technology not entailing excessive costs.
Whereas the primary objective of such measures is the promotion of public health by ensuring the availability of adequate supplies of medicinal products at a reasonable cost; whereas , however , such measures should also be intended to promote efficiency in the production of medicinal products and to encourage research and development into new medicinal products , on which the maintenance of a high level of public health within the Community ultimately depends.
Whereas , as a result , amounts of levies and refunds fixed in advance may vary in national currency; whereas the advance fixing of levies and refunds therefore constitutes an risk for operators; whereas , as a consequence , the operative event should be defined as the date of acceptance of the application for the advance fixing of levies or refunds for the purposes of applying the conversion rate for calculating those amounts in national currency.
( 1 ) Whereas Council Directive 77/143/EEC of 29 December 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers ( 4 ) has been substantially amended on a number of occasions; whereas , now that it is to be further amended , the Directive should , for reasons of clarity , be consolidated into a single text.
Whereas , in the current state of analytical techniques , it is not possible to determine all the conditions under which conventional migration tests should be performed on materials and articles consisting of two or more layers , one or more of which does not consist entirely of plastics; whereas a decision on the application of this Directive to such materials and articles should therefore be taken at a later date.
Whereas it is understood between the Member States and the Commission that Sweden will pursue the detailed examination for the dossier and report the conclusions of its examination accompanied by any recommendations on the inclusion or non-inclusion and any conditions related thereto to the Commission as soon as possible and at the latest within a period of one year; whereas on receipt of the report the detailed examination will be continued with the expertise from all Member States within the framework of the Standing Committee on Plant Health.
Whereas Regulation ( EEC ) No 2658/87 has set down the general rules for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature and these rules also apply to any other nomenclature which is wholly or partly based on it or which adds any additional subdivisions to it and which is established by specific Community provisions , with a view to the application of tariff or other measures relating to trade in goods.
Whereas the threshold quantities applicable for a harvest may exceed those fixed for the previous harvest for certain groups of varieties while falling short of those fixed for others; whereas the additional quantities should be distributed among the parties concerned on the basis of objective criteria , taking account of certain priorities to be determined by the Member States in the light of their situation.

Whereas the holding by the central banks of coins issued by the public sector and credited to the public sector constitutes an interest-free form of credit for the public sector; whereas , however , if only limited amounts are involved , this practice does not interfere with the principle of Article 104 of the Treaty; whereas , therefore , in view of the difficulties which would arise from total prohibition of this form of credit , it may be permitted within the limits laid down in this Regulation.
Whereas application of the Agreement on agriculture could be jeopardized if the internal procedures to be used differed substantially between different sectors; whereas , for that reason , it is desirable to make those procedures uniform.
Whereas Regulation ( EEC ) No 2358/71 also requires that contracts for seed multiplication in a non-member country must be defined ; whereas it is also necessary to provide that the contracting party established in the Community should provide certain particulars when the contract is registered.

Whereas , according to the first subparagraph of Article 9 ( 5 ) the proof required for the release of the processing security must be furnished within a period of 12 months as from the conclusion of the contract; whereas , owing to administrative difficulties , the said period should be extended to 18 months.
Whereas some of the information regarding the consignee are already contained in the health certificates required for the import of animals , semen , ova and embryos; whereas therefore this information shall not be on the pedigree and zootechnical certificate.

Whereas Article 7 of Regulation ( EEC ) No 1696/71 lays down the conditions producer groups must fulfil in order to be recognized , whereas it has become evident that several recognized producer groups in the Community have experienced great difficulties in practising common marketing of their members' produce.
Whereas , in order to ensure proper administration of the system , the security for import licences under the said system should be fixed at ECU 30 per 100 kilograms; whereas , in view of the risk of speculation inherent in the system in the pigmeat sector , precise conditions governing access by traders to the said system should be laid down.
Whilst studies in rats and mice have not produced any evidence of teratogenic effect , the safety in pregnant and lactating sows has not been established .

Whereas Article G of the Treaty on European Union replaced the term 'European Economic Community` with the term 'European Community`; whereas the abbreviation 'EEC` should therefore be replaced by the abbreviation 'EC` in the abovementioned provisions.
( 4 ) Whereas , in cases of major currency revaluation with potential effects on prices and amounts other than direct aid , farm incomes may in certain conditions be reduced; whereas as a consequence provision could justifiably be made for temporary , degressive aid to offset the effects of revaluations , and keep pace with the development of agricultural prices in a manner compatible with the rules of the general economy.
Whereas under the Voluntary Restraint Agreements concluded with the European Economic Community on mutton , lamb and goatmeat or live sheep and goats , the non-member countries in question undertook , in exchanges of letters , to limit the amount of their exports to certain Community markets considered to be sensitive areas; whereas those undertakings , however , expire on 31 March 1984.
Whereas , as a result of the abolition of the principle of taxes on imports in relations between Member States , the provisions on exemptions and allowances on imports cease to apply in respect of relations between Member States; whereas these provisions should therefore be abolished and the directives concerned adapted accordingly.
Whereas the international standards for fresh fruit and vegetables laid down by the Economic Commission for Europe clearly define how the identity of the packer and dispatcher are to be indicated on packaging; whereas , in particular for reasons of legal clarity , those international provisions should be incorporated into all the Community standards for fresh fruit and vegetables.
Whereas , with a view to facilitating the crossing of these frontiers , in an initial stage the said quantity should be increased for vehicles which are designed for , and capable of , the transport of passengers; whereas the Council is to decide at a later date on the increase applicable to vehicles which are designed for , and capable of , the transport of goods.
Whereas the said Council Regulation and Council Directive contain the appropriate provisions concerning the right of workers to reside in the territory of a Member State for the purposes of employment ; whereas the right to remain , referred to in Article 48 ( 3 ) ( d ) of the Treaty ; is interpreted therefore as the right of the worker to maintain his residence in the territory of a Member State when he ceases to be employed there.
Whereas Article 30 ( 5 ) of the Single European Act determines that the external policies of the European Community and the policies agreed in European Political Cooperation must be consistent; whereas , therefore , Member States may be allowed to maintain some restrictions on exports until 31 December 1992 , in particular on those exports for which restrictions have been agreed in European Political Cooperation.
Whereas it is essential that all those involved in the production , use , import and distribution of packaging and packaged products become more aware of the extent to which packaging becomes waste , and that in accordance with the polluter-pays principle they accept responsibility for such waste; whereas the development and implementation of the measures provided for in this Directive should involve and require the close cooperation of all the partners , where appropriate , within a spirit of shared responsibility.
Whereas national provisions relating to personal protective equipment differ significantly from one Member State to another; whereas they may thus constitute a barrier to trade with direct consequences for the creation and operation of the common market.
Whereas the Commission believes that precise description of the composition of the preparations and recommendations to wear masks and protective clothing are not sufficient to guarantee the protection of operators at plant or farm level; whereas cases have indeed been reported to the Commission of livestock farmers who , lacking protection , have been exposed through inhalation or skin contact to the genotoxic and potentially carcinogenic parent substances.
In certain circumstances , however , such as where the parties agree not to carry out other research and development in the same field , thereby forgoing the opportunity of gaining competitive advantages over the other parties , such agreements may fall within Article 81 ( 1 ) and should therefore be included within the scope of this Regulation .
Whereas Article 7 ( 1 ) of Regulation ( EEC ) No 2054/89 lays down the terms under which the minimum import price may be deemed to be observed; whereas experience shows that , to avoid distortion , account must to be taken of the customs import charges actually paid and of the cost of any treatment the imported product undergoes after importation and prior to sale to the end user.
Whereas it is possible and desirable to increase electricity transfers between grids and also take account of the imperatives of security and quality of electricity supply; whereas studies show that such greater electricity transfers between grids can minimize the cost of investment and fuels involved in electricity generation and transmission and ensure optimum use of the means of production and infrastructure.
Whereas the fees to be levied should cover solely the actual wage , social welfare and administrative costs of the body carrying out the services; whereas it is appropriate to lay down an exhaustive list of costs to be taken into account for the calculation of the said fees.
Whereas the Convention aims to help protect the environment in the area of waste through more stringent control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and other waste and through ecologically sound management thereof; whereas , in this respect , it determines procedures for controls on imports , exports and transit.

Whereas pharmaceutical companies are bound by essential requirements for the development of medicinal products relating to , inter alia , clinical and toxicological studies; whereas these essential requirements vary according to whether the medicinal product is intended for domestic animals , animals producing food for human consumption or both categories of animal.
Whereas the competent authorities of Chile have provided official assurances regarding compliance with the requirements specified in Chapter V of the Annex to Directive 91/492/EEC and with requirements equivalent to those prescribed in that Directive for the classification of production and relaying zones , approval of dispatch and purification centres and public health control and production monitoring; whereas , in particular , any possible change in harvesting zones is to be communicated to the Community.
Whereas it is recognized that a greater understanding of the mechanisms of action of chemical substances in man and the extrapolation of effects seen in other species to man are under continuous development; whereas in the case of further scientific evidence or change in the criteria for classification relating especially to the carcinogenic or neurotoxicological effects of this substance , the classification will be reviewed in the light of this new information.
Whereas the constant increase in environmental pollution caused by the rapid increase in traffic in the Community necessitates not only the adoption of limit values and tougher standards but also the development of alternative propulsion systems and transport concepts ; whereas the Community should take steps to provide financial support for research and development for alternative transport concepts , propulsion systems and fuels taking into account the requirements of environmental compatibility.
( 2 ) Since the bilateral negotiations in progress with the United States of America will not end before the end of the year , in order to prevent any disruption of trade , the rules applicable to wines imported from the United States of America should be extended in the light of the progress of the negotiations .
( 3 ) Whereas the completion of the internal market offers a dynamic environment for the transnational provision of services , prompting a growing number of undertakings to post employees abroad temporarily to perform work in the territory of a Member State other than the State in which they are habitually employed.
Whereas it should be laid down that fresh meat intended for the manufacture of meat products must come from approved establishments; whereas such establishments must satisfy the conditions laid down in Directive 72/462/EEC.
Whereas it appears necessary to supplement the rules by adding provisions on proof of certification of products coming from a split consignment ; whereas it seems appropriate to adopt a similar system covering the resale of hop products imported from non-member countries , after a consignment is split up.
Whereas experience has shown that for quantities in excess of 3 000 tonnes operators are encountering real difficulties in observing the time limits , in particular where the oil is distributed between several intervention centres; whereas the time limit for withdrawing the oil in such a case should be extended under certain conditions in order to enable intervention sales to be conducted properly.
Whereas a provisional list of establishments producing poultry meat products can thus be drawn up for South Africa; whereas Decision 97/569/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
Whereas , due to the reform of the common agricultural policy , the intervention prices for cereals are considerable reduced with effect from the 1993/94 marketing year; whereas it is therefore appropriate that missing quantities recorded during the 1994 financial year should be valued at the intervention price of the preceding marketing year as the majority of quantities in intervention stock were purchased during that marketing year.
Whereas further refinement of the requirements as laid down in this Regulation should be considered , in particular with regard to the conditions of use including the maximum percentage of manure not from holdings producing according to the organic production method , the characteristics and the origin of the mycelium; whereas the preparatory works in this respect should be started in due time in order to be finalised before the end of the transitional period.
Whereas the Council , in its Decision 90/683/EEC of 13 December 1990 concerning the modules for the various phases of the conformity assessment procedures which are intended to be used in the technical harmonization directives ( 5 ) , introduced harmonized means of applying procedures for conformity assessment; whereas the application of these modules to explosives will make it possible to determine the responsibility of manufacturers and of bodies responsible for applying procedures for conformity assessment by taking account of the nature of the explosives concerned.
Whereas , therefore , Member States must take measures to facilitate implementation of the provisions of this Directive by undertakings , in particular small and medium-sized undertakings; whereas such measures may include training and information activities adapted to the specific requirements of the various sectors of the economy.
Whereas money laundering is usually carried out in an international context so that the criminal origin of the funds can be better disguised; whereas measures exclusively adopted at a national level , without taking account of international coordination and cooperation , would have very limited effects.
Whereas the aim of such minimum quality requirements is to avoid production of products for which there is no demand or products which would create distortion of the market; whereas the requirements must be based on traditional fair manufacturing procedures.
Whereas such extension of the transitional period should be considered if sufficient experience has not been gained for setting reasonable levels of fees ensuring the principle of self-financing whilst safeguarding the attractiveness of the Community system of plant variety protection; whereas such experience could only be gained by observing the number of applications for a Community plant variety right , the costs paid to the Examination Offices and the actual duration of Community plant variety rights granted.
Whereas it seems appropriate to add the persistent organo-chlorine compound camphechlor to the list of prohibited active substances since its use is likely to give rise to harmful effects on human and animal health as well as unreasonable adverse effects on the environment; whereas the Commission has consulted the Scientific Committee on Pesticides regarding this compound.
Whereas the Member States should be entitled , with the Commission's authorization , to grant exceptions from the provisions of the Regulation in exceptional circumstances; whereas in urgent cases , it should be possible to grant these exceptions for a limited time without prior authorization from the Commission.
( 4 ) Whereas fruit bats are occasionally imported from third countries; whereas pending Community animal health conditions for imports from third countries of fruit bats , it appears necessary to introduce certain protection measures with regard to Hendra and Nipah diseases.
Whereas experience has shown that , in order to ensure greater comparability of prices , it is enough to deduct the value tax from the price paid to the supplier for the animal on delivery to the slaughterhouse; whereas Regulation ( EEC ) No 563/82 should therefore be amended accordingly.
Whereas , in order to ensure effective checking , the equipment must be reliable in operation , easy to use and designed in such a way as to minimize any possibility of fraudulent use; whereas to this end recording equipment should in particular be capable of providing , on separate sheets for each driver and in a sufficiently precise and easily readable form , recorded details of the various periods of time.
Whereas lack of Community action against money laundering could lead Member States , for the purpose of protecting their financial systems , to adopt measures which could be inconsistent with completion of the single market; whereas , in order to facilitate their criminal activities , launderers could try to take advantage of the freedom of capital movement and freedom to supply financial services which the integrated financial area involves , if certain coordinating measures are not adopted at Community level.
The Community authorization shall be made out in the haulier's name , he may not transfer it to any third party .

Neupopeg contains less than 1 mmol ( 23 mg ) sodium per 6 mg dose , i . e . essentially sodium-free .
Whereas the system of compulsory specialization at present applied by one Member State , namely the Federal Republic of Germany , precludes the majority of conflicts; whereas , however , it does not appear necessary , in order to obtain this result , to extend that system to the entire Community , which would require the splitting-up of composite undertakings.
Whereas however certain components , in particular straw and manure , can currently not be obtained in sufficient quantities from organic production; whereas therefore it is appropriate to foresee an appropriate transitional period to permit producers to adapt to the new requirements.
Whereas measures should be adopted for the achievement of the internal market; whereas the internal market is an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods , persons , services and capital is guaranteed.
Whereas the abovementioned elements include personal data which are subject to specific protective measures; whereas , in particular , these data may be introduced into the database only when the conditions set out in Article 27 ( 2 ) of the Basic Regulation are met.

Whereas , in order to determine the most suitable aid strategies , nuclear safety has to be viewed as part of the problem of the overall energy options of the countries of central and eastern Europe and of the former Soviet Union; noting in this context the conclusions of the report drawn up jointly in June 1993 by the World Bank , the International Energy Agency and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Whereas those Agreements were signed at the same time as the Agreement on the European Economic Area between the European Economic Community , the European Coal and Steel Community and the Member States thereof , of the one part , and the Member States of the European Free Trade Association , of the other part , hereinafter referred to as the 'EEA Agreement'; whereas the objective of all parties was to ensure that the EEA Agreement and the Bilateral Agreements on agriculture entered into force at the same time.
Whereas the Community has adopted a series of Decisions setting requirements applying to importation of fishery products originating in certain third countries; whereas these Decisions include a model of the health certificate that is to accompany consignments.

( 1 ) Whereas the principle animal health conditions to be complied with by Member States when importing from third countries dogs , cats and other animals susceptible to rabies are laid down in Directive 92/65/EEC ( 3 ) ; whereas however the veterinary certification is not yet harmonized.
Whereas the quantities produced and qualifying for the premium must be determined in respect of each producer; whereas the Member States should divide up the quotas among the growers concerned , subject to the guarantee thresholds fixed , the aim of the Community rules laid down for the purpose being to ensure fair allocation on the basis of quantities delivered in the past , unusually high or low production figures being disregarded.
Whereas the derogations provided for in Article 7 ( 1 ) are no longer granted by the Member States; whereas they should therefore be deleted.
Whereas the difficulties on the market in Russia are continuing and whereas the situation thereby created has seriously affected operators' possibilities of exporting to that destination; whereas the damaging consequences of this must accordingly be limited by the adoption of special measures enabling the export licences and certain customs procedures already initiated to be cancelled and certain time limits to be extended.

( 4 ) Whereas , for the control of residues , as provided for in appropriate Community legislation , maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney; whereas , however , the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcasses moving in international trade , and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues.
( 4 ) Whereas it is necessary , in the course of the operation of the common market and for the changeover to the single currency , to provide legal certainty for citizens and firms in all Member States on certain provisions relating to the introduction of the euro well before the entry into the third stage; whereas this legal certainty at an early stage will allow preparations by citizens and firms to proceed under good conditions.
